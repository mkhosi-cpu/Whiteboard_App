Project Scenario

A sudden shift to remote work globally has created an opportunity to provide better remote collaboration tooling.
You've identified an opportunity to create a simple yet powerful collaborative whiteboard and you've partnered with a 
friend who has created the first version. Your job is to get it out into the world and make sure it's ready to handle a 
potential surge of users who are desperate for a better solution to this problem.

After some consideration, you've decided on using the following products:

- EKS (AWS )for hosting the application
- AWS products for supportive services (e.g. Load Balancing, DNS, etc.)
- Terraform for creating the infrastructure
